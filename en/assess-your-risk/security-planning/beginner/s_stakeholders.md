### Who else is involved, and what are *they* trying to do? 

These are stakeholders. 

Identifying and describing different stakeholders in relation to your work will help you identify adversaries who pose a threat, and sources of protection. 

## Stakeholder Analysis Questions

* Who are the main actors involved in factors that could affect my work? 

*Consider military, law enforcement, security or intelligence officials, powerful individuals, institutions, local, national, regional and international organisations, opposition groups, businesses, the media, community leaders, conservative religious groups, other states, criminal groups, even members of your own family.*
 
* How does my work affect these actors and their interests? 
* How do they perceive me? 
* What motivation and what resources do they have to help or hinder my work? 
* Which stakeholders align with each other? Which oppose each other?  

Use your context assessment and stakeholder analysis to identify threats, vulnerabilities, and capacities.
