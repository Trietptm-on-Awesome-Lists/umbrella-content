title: Your Security Plan
---
### Your security plan should be a written document. 

It needs to be: 

* Clear; 
* Partial and selective. Prioritise, or it will be overwhelming; 
* Easy to act on, even under stress, or if you haven't seen it in a few months (who is responsible for doing what, and when?); 
* Realistic (how long will your recommendations take to implement, and how much will they cost?); 
* Available to everyone who needs it;
* Secure. 

*Security plans generally describe measures you will take to protect your team from adversaries. If your adversaries access your plans, they can obstruct your security measures.*     

Include:
 
* Threats you face, and your vulnerabilities; 
* Capacities you already have;
* Recommendations to reduce vulnerabilities and increase capacities; 
* Who decides when you are secure enough to continue to work, and when to stop; 
* Recommendations for responding to a specific threat in an emergency scenario;
* The date you wrote the plan, and the schedule for reviewing and updating it;
* How you found the information you used, to strengthen your credibility and make it easier to update.
