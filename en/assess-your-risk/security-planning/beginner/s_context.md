### Where you are and what are you trying to do? 

This is your context.  

Understanding your context is the first step to increasing your security. 

## Context Assessment Questions 

* What is my mission, or what am I trying to achieve?  
* What do I provide or create, and who is it for? 
* In this specific country or area, what factors could affect my work? 

*Consider politics, economic issues, religion, culture, conflict, crime, geography, infrastructure, climate, disease, natural disasters.*

* What are my main sources of information about what's happening in my context?  
* What assumptions about my context can I test? 

Use this information to identify other stakeholders active in your context.
