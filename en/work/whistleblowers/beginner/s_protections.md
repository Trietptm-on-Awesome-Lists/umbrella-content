### Research your local context before revealing sensitive information. 

Find or set up a clean device and use Tor if your search history could expose your plans to the wrong people. For example, don't search information about exposing your boss from your work computer.

## Laws and regulations

Some organisations and some countries have special protections for whistleblowers. 

If you are considering exposing wrongdoing by whistleblowing, find out:

* What legal or institutional protections are you entitled to, if any?
* What resources do your adversaries have to stop you or uncover your identity?
* What steps will those you tell take to protect your identity and your information, if any? 

## Communicating with journalists

News organisations often have specific rules about sources. For example, a journalist may share information about their source with an editor, but no-one else.  

Understand a journalist's committment to source protection before you share information. 

* Have they or their organisation stated that they will protect sources? 
* Have they defended sources before? 
* Where do they store their notes, and how do they protect them? 
* Do they use secure communications? 

*A journalist who knows your identity may be threatened or otherwise forced to disclose it, even if they promise you confidentiality.*
