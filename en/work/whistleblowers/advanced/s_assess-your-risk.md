title: Assess your risk
---
### If you are a journalist or investigate wrongdoing, sources or whistleblowers may put themselves at risk to share information with you. 

A whistleblower reports information about wrongdoing that affects their community because they want to improve the situation. 

This may involve leaking internal documents, recordings, or other evidence. Often they may face repercussions for sharing information without permission, even in the public interest.

Adversaries or law enforcement may try to force you to disclose this information, and who gave it to you. 

It is your responsibility to understand the risks you face from protecting sources before you accept sensitive information. 

## Assess your risk

* Understand how the laws you are subject to could help you protect your sources. 

* If laws could require you to hand over your sources, will you be allowed to challenge requests to do so in court? 

* Have other people been prosecuted or threatened for leaking information, or for refusing to reveal the identify of a source?

*Protecting sources is more important than breaking news. If you lack experience protecting sources, or if you are not a journalist and the media are not among your adversaries, consider working with professional journalists you trust who may have better legal protection and resources to manage sensitive information. However, only do so if you are sure it will increase protection for your source. Don't betray your source's trust or share sensitive information with more people than you need to.*
