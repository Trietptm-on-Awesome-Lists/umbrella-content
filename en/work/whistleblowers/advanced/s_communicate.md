Sources who don't understand the risks, or lack experience protecting their identity, may expose themselves by reaching out to you. 

You can't always control this, but you can help educate people who are considering leaking information. 
 
## Communicate

* Make potential sources aware of their risk; 
* Make potential sources aware of risks attached to different communciation methods (for example, a Wi-Fi network maintained by an employer, or Tor in a country where it may attract negative attention from authorities);  

## Post a tips page

Consider sharing information about risks and safer communication on a tips page. 

Examples:   

* The New York Times at [https://www.nytimes.com/tips](https://www.nytimes.com/tips).
* Journalist Barton Gellman at [https://www.bartongellman.com/pgp](https://www.bartongellman.com/pgp).

## Physical addresses

Consider sharing a physical address if appropriate for your context and level of risk. 

* Information shared through the post may be better protected from surveillance in some jurisdictions. 
* You may also need to vet deliveries for attacks or threats.
