## Secure Drop

Secure Drop is free, open source software that media houses and NGOs can use to securely receive information from anonymous whistleblowers. 

The first installation takes time, but sources will know that you are committed to protecting their privacy. 

Find out more at (https://securedrop.org/)[https://securedrop.org/]. 

Secure Drop is used by outlets like The Associated Press, The Guardian, and The Intercept. 

Access Secure Drop through Tor to be sure you are using it anonymously.

## Meet people where they are

If sources lack digital literacy, some security tools may scare them and cause them to default to a more familiar, but less secure communication method. 

Use judgement when choosing communication channels. In some contexts, this may mean using WhatsApp instead of PGP encryption, even if WhatsApp is not the most secure option available.

* Choose secure communication channels to suit your main audience or community;
* Create accounts that are not attached to your regular online activity where possible and encourage sources to do the same;
* Write clear, simple instructions for anyone unfamiliar with them, or link to tutorials and tool guides. 

## Help people up their game

Some secure messengers are attached to a phone number or account that may be enough to reveal your source has contacted you, even if what they said is encrypted. In some contexts, this could put you and them at risk. 

If potential adversaries in your context include government or intelligence agencies, provide sources with encouragment and instruction to try a more secure method.  

[Ricochet.im](https://ricochet.im/) is one example. It is free, open source software that allows you to exchange end-to-end encrypted messages through the Tor network using a unique address instead of a user name.
