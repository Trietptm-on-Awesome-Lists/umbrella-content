Play out different scenarios in your head before the meeting. 

## If plans change

What will you do if:

*   Someone is late?

*   Someone arrives with an uninvited third party?

*   Someone doesn't show up?

*   Someone is made temporarily insecure by: 
	*	Talking to an unknown third party;
    *	Being stopped or recognised;
    *	Drawing attention to themselves?
   
*   You attract interest or threats from a third party?

## Plan interactions

*   How much information you are going to share?
