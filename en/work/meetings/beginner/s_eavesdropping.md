# Bugs

Hidden recording devices are:

*	Cheap, widespread and effective. 
*	Very hard to identify.
 
Many bugs look like ordinary items or electronic devices. 

_In some countries, hotels are routinely bugged to spy on business people, diplomats, NGOs, and other guests._

## Avoid bugs

*	Be unpredictable; 
*	Change locations frequently; 
*	Avoid homes, hotels, offices, and other frequented locations.  
*	Protect travel plans and itineraries to reduce the time available to plant a device.

_For example, don't publicize which hotel conference room will be used during an event._

## Assume the room is bugged

If dealing with sensitive matters, always assume the room is bugged. 

*	Unplug all unnecessary electronic devices. 

*	If possible, turn electricity off at the mains and check behind plug sockets and light switches. 

*	Examine items such as smoke alarms, lamps, or clocks for devices, unexpected wires, or signs of tampering. 

*	Turn on loud music or TV. (Be aware that advanced bugs can eliminate extra sounds.)

*	Turn off your phone and remove the battery on the way to a meeting.

*	Put your phone in another room in case the microphone can be activated remotely.

### Service staff, like cleaners or waiters, may also eavesdrop.
