# If you Identify Surveillance

### Assess the risk

Some teams will want to confront anyone suspicious.  

*	What might they be doing? 
*	Is there a history of threats against you or your team? How serious? 
*	Is it likely that they will attack you?
*	Is it likely that they will leave and be replaced? (This may undermine your ability to identify and monitor surveillance.)

### Increase protection

Reduce the adversary's ability to conduct surveillance. 
Consider: 

*	Closing blinds;
*	Locking gates;
*	Putting up a screen or barrier;
*	Making it harder to access the building;
*	Installing CCTV or guards;
*	Moving to a site which cannot be overlooked.

### Continue monitoring

*	Monitor the general security environment for possible threats;
*	Increase monitoring during periods of tension, such as protests, elections, or sensitive national holidays.
