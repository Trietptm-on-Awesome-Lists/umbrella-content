## Is Your Office Under Surveillance?

The number of fixed sites where your adversary can observe you are limited. 

Think like an adversary:

*	Where would you target?
*	How would you conduct surveillance? 
*	From where?

## Detect surveillance

### Take a baseline 

Understand normal conditions. 

_Where do people usually stand?_

### Document 

*	Identify unusual activity;
*	Record them in a log.

_Is someone standing somewhere unexpected?_

### Filter out coincidence 

*	Concentrate on unusual activities;
*	Apply common sense.

_Do they look local? Are they paying unusual attention to you?_

**Look for 3 unusual signs or 3 repeat sightings.**

(Learn more about this in [Being Followed advanced](umbrella://work/being-followed/advanced).)

### Notify others

*	Inform your team of your suspicions;
*	Coordinate monitoring;
*	Document patterns to confirm or disprove your suspicions. 
 
### Trust your instinct 

*	Don't ignore suspicions;
*	Don't assume you are paranoid. 

Unusual activity may be a warning sign of a pending security incident.
