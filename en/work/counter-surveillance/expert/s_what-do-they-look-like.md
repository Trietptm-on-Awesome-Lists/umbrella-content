title: What do they look like?

# Look for vehicles:

## Equipped for surveillance

*   Mounted with unusual aerials or boxes;
*   Carrying maps, radios, GPS, binoculars, cameras, etc.
*	Carrying rubbish or supplies for a long wait. 

## Easy to overlook

*   The most common makes and colours;
*	Taxis, rickshaws, vans or expensive cars, depending on the location.

## Behaving differently

Consider stationary vehicles: 

*   Parked to allow a quick exit;
*	With shades or sun visors down to obscure faces;
*   Running the engine or with brake lights on;
*   With cracked windows;
*   With one or two occupants;
*   With occupants who talk, but not apparently to each other; or operate a radio. 

*Note: people may sit in the back or observe from the boot or trunk of a parked vehicle.* 

## Working together  

Two vehicles stopping in the same place may indicate:

*	A watcher is being relieved;
*   A team with poor discipline is having a chat.

# Document vehicle descriptions

*	Vehicle registration;
*	Colour, make, and model;
*	Unique descriptive features.
