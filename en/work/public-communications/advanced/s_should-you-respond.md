title: Should you respond?
---
### Responding directly to counter an attack may be necessary in some circumstances, but it is also likely to reinforce the wrong message or fix people's views against you.

Deciding whether, and how to respond to disinformation is very difficult. 

Many experts believe that attention feeds disinformation. 

* Since responding supplies attention, it is likely to fuel the fire, not put it out. 
* Some people believe people who read responses to disinformation are more likely to remember the disinformation, due to repeated exposure, than the counter-argument.
* Logic and factual information is unlikely to change minds influenced by strong emotions like fear.   

Ignoring an attack feels counter-intuitive, and may not always be the best approach. Expert assessments may evolve based on research, or vary depending on the context.     

## Assessment questions

Collect data to inform these decisions in advance as part of your crisis communications plan, if possible. 

* Could the reports die out if you ignore them? 
* Could you publish information about something else positive instead?  
* Why do you feel the need to respond? Are you acting on instinct or is there a compelling reason?  
* Who are the most important stakeholders involved in your work? Will they understand and support your decision to respond or not? 
* Can you respond without appearing antagonistic or defensive?
* Will your response just reinforce a negative or inaccurate message by bringing more people's attention to it?   
* What have other people in a similar situation done, and how did it work out? 
* Can you take advice? 

*Make sure you have a compelling reason, don't deliberate too long, and be prepared to reassess and adapt your strategy based on information available to you at the time.*
