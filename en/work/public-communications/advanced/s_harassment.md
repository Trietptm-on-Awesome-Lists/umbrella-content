### Disinformation campaigns may facilitate, or accompany, other organised campaigns to disrupt and discredit you. 

Examples include: 

## Judicial or legal harassment 

* Demanding or invasive investigations into you and your activites.  
* One or several criminal or civil charges that you are forced to fight in court, even if they have no merit, or are clearly designed to inconvenience you by taking you to a court far away or incurring significant costs.  
* Fines, prison terms, or other penalties for supposed wrongdoing, from traffic violations to tax evasion to treason, that are clearly intended to punish you for something unrelated.

* Passing laws or giving orders to ban certain activies, groups, or sources of funding.
