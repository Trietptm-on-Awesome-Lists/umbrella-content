# Don't be a target 

## Be cautious.

This will mean different things depending on the local context.

*	Restrict movements to a minimum during periods of high risk.  

*	Use common sense. Don't walk alone or drive at night.

*	Verify events or incidents before responding.

## Don't be predictable.

50% of abductions take place while the victim is in their car, often in the early morning, within 400 meters of the target's home or office.

*	Travel by different routes at different times.

*	Vary routine during travel, work, and recreation.  

*	Roadblocks or car accidents may be staged to provide cover for abductors disguised as officials.

## Reduce visibility.  

* Travel low profile. For example, consider a trusted taxi rather than an official work vehicle.

* Protect your communications.

(Learn about [Sending a Message](umbrella://lesson/sending-a-message) and [Making a Call](umbrella://lesson/making-a-call).) 

* Don't discuss personal information or plans if you may be overheard. 

* Use code words for names, locations, and travel information.
