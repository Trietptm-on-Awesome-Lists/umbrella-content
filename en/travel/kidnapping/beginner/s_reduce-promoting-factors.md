*	Avoid 'no-go' areas in town; 
*	Don't display assets.

## Build key relationships.

* Build relationships with key actors, leaders, or respected elders who may help prevent kidnapping. 

*Only good knowledge of the context will determine whether this tactic will reduce the risk.*

   *  Are hosts responsible for the wellbeing of their guests? 
   *  Can you travel or work with a local representative?
