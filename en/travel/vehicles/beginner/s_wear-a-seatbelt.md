title: Wear a seatbelt
---
### The most important security advice you will ever hear is: ALWAYS WEAR A SEATBELT.

*	Road accidents are a major cause of injuries and fatalities. 

*	Driving in unfamiliar and difficult conditions can increase the likelihood of an accident. 

Other dangers may include: 

*	Ambush;
*	Robbery;
*	Intimidation by armed personnel at checkpoints. 

Before travel, anyone driving should train in: 

*	Driver safety, driver awareness, or defensive driving.
*	Basic vehicle maintenance (changing a tyre, checking fluids, etc.).

*"Research has shown that human beings overestimate risks that continue to be talked about, and underestimate risks that are so common that they hardly get attention (for instance, car accidents)."*
