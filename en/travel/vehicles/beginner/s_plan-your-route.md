## Plan your route

*   Plan primary and alternate routes, especially in remote or insecure areas.

*   Avoid areas with known criminal activity or other threats. 

*	Avoid choke points, such as narrow alleys.

(Learn more about this in [counter-surveillance expert](umbrella://operations/counter/surveillance/expert).)

*   Consult experts about route conditions. Change routes as necessary. 

*	Monitor traffic ahead, especially when approaching checkpoints or obstructions.

### Look up:

*	Weather reports.
*   Recent incidents. *Check the Feed for information about your area.*
*   Location of known checkpoints.

(Learn about [checkpoints](umbrella://travel/checkpoints).)

*   Other danger points. 
	* Does the route pass through an area controlled by military, a warlord or local leader? 
    * Have you negotiated passage or obtained necessary permission?
    * Conflict lines and areas of insecurity should be rigorously checked before travel. Are there reports of landmines, improvised explosives, or munitions targeting personnel or vehicles?      
*   Safe waypoints.
*   Refuelling stops.
*   Food stops.
