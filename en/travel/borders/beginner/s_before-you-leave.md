# Know your risk

Borders represent the possibility for detention, intimidation, interrogation, and search.

If you travel with sensitive information or equipment, or to carry out sensitive work, there are steps you can take to mitigate risk.

First, understand: 

*	The reasons for your trip; 
*	Possible sensitivities of your trip. 

(Learn about risk assessment for travel [preparation](umbrella://travel/preparation).)

This may depend on: 

1. The nature of the information you will be carrying;
2. How you will carry it.

## 1. Sensitive information may include:

*   Communications with people you work with or plan to meet;
*   Banned information or publications; 
*   Financial information or receipts;
*   Embarrassing or incriminating information;
*	Itineraries, standard operating procedures, and security protocols.

(Learn about procedures in travel [preparation](umbrella://travel/preparation).)

## 2. Sensitive information may be stored in: 

*	Laptops, phones, or other devices;
*	Remote servers operated by email or cloud storage providers;
*	Notebooks and publications;
*	USB stick, portable hard drives, SD card, or CD-ROMs.
 
(Learn about identifying and organising information in [backing up](umbrella://information/backing-up).)

## Protect your information

### Only carry what you really need.  

* Delete non-essential information from devices.  
* Back up information securely and remotely before travel.
* Carry sensitive information securely. (If necessary, keep a small USB stick or microSD card somewhere harder to find.)

(Learn about [backing up](umbrella://information/backing-up), [safely deleting](umbrella://information/safely-deleting), and [protecting files](umbrella://information/protecting-files).)

### Carry sensitive information and equipment in hand luggage.
If sensitive items are with you, you will know if they have been tampered with. 

### Empty pockets, wallet, and bags of non-essential items.
