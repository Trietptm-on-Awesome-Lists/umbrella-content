## On seeing a checkpoint

*	Discreetly inform your team or your base that you are approaching a checkpoint. 
*	If possible, communicate at a distance. 

*Limit sudden movement, like reaching for a communications device, in view of the checkpoint.*  

## Prepare the vehicle

*   Slow down.
*   Place valuables out of sight.
*   After dark, turn cabin light on and headlights off. 
*   Keep a reasonable distance between vehicles.
*   Open the window far enough for conversation, not far enough for someone to reach in. 
*   Follow signals given by checkpoint personnel.
*	Stop if unsure (e.g. are they waving me on or into the side of the road?). 
*	Consider activating voice recording discreetly before approaching an officer in case of an incident.

*Assess the risk of being caught recording; make sure it isn't obvious if your device is confiscated.*

## Prepare yourself.

*   During the day, remove sunglasses. 
*   Prepare your ID. 
*	Agree your cover story.
	* Where have you come from? 
    * Where you are going?
    * Who do you work for?
    * What is the vehicle carrying?  
*   Choose a spokesperson.
