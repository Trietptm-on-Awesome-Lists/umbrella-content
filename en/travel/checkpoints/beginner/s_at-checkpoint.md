# General guidelines

*	Stay calm.
*	Demonstrate that you are not a threat.
*	Follow local etiquette. 

(Research etiquette when you [plan your route](umbrella://lesson/vehicles).)

## Your vehicle

*   Stop a few meters from the barrier.
*   Keep engine running, unless told otherwise.
*   Remain in the vehicle, unless told otherwise.
*   Comply with searches.

## Your actions

*	Avoid sudden movements, which may suggest you are reaching for a weapon.
*   Keep hands visible.
*	Announce movements in advance, and keep movements slow. 
*   If asked to get out, release seatbelt slowly. 

## Your behaviour

*   Be friendly, co-operative and alert. 
*	Treat checkpoint personnel with respect.
*   Do not laugh.
*   Refuse inappropriate requests politely but firmly. Use gentle humour if appropriate.
*	If appropriate, chat a little, perhaps about their family.

*Checkpoint personnel have a boring job. They may give you an easier time if you show an interest.* 

## Use your judgement

*   A soldier asking for money is a negotiation. A solider pointing his gun at you and demanding money is armed robbery. 
*   If something is stolen, politely ask for it back. (Accept the loss in threatening situations.)
*	If threatened with a weapon, comply calmly.
*	Report incidents to your team. 
*   Refuse lifts to armed or uniformed personnel if at all possible.

## When you leave

*   Don't look back.
*   Once out of view, update your team or base.
