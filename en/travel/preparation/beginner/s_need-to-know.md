# Who *really* needs to know? 

Telling fewer people about your trip helps keep it more secure. But travel preparation often involves sharing information. 

Balance security and practicality with a need to know policy. 

(Learn more about this in [managing information](umbrella://information/managing-information).)

Information you have prepared about your trip may include: 

*   Strategic, context, and risk assessment;
*	Copies of key documents and medical information;
*	Communication methods and contact information;
*   Itinerary and other standard operating procedures;
*   Security and emergency protocols. 

For each item, ask: 

*	Who needs to have knowledge of this information? 
*	How will they protect it?
