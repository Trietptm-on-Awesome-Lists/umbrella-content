## Radio or Satphones

These may be necessary if telecommunications networks are unreliable or may be shut down in a crisis. Check they are legal at your destination. 

*Note: radio antennae are conspicuous. Use mobile phones with a satphone as backup if you are travelling low profile.*

## Contacts

*   Programme essential contact information into your device, but not sensitive numbers. 
*   Add emergency numbers (such as 112, 911, 999 or similar).
*	Try to memorize emergency phone numbers. 
*   Store essential numbers separate from your device in case it is lost or stolen. Use code words where necessary.
*	Store sensitive contact information securely. 
*	If you really need to add sensitive contact information to your device in a hurry, create notes or reminders instead of the phone book. Disguise phone numbers and use code words where necessary.

*Disguise numbers as dates, measurements, coordinates, quantities on a shopping list, or another formulation.*
