### Standard operating procedures are step-by-step instructions for any scenario. Establish these before your trip and share them with your team.

If required, inform authorities or embassies of your travel plans.

Check in regularly with someone who is not travelling with you and can provide support if you fail to check in due to an emergency.

*	Assess the territory for known danger points like checkpoints and landmines.
