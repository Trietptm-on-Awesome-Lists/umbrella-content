## If you're suspicious about any attachment: 

* Don't open the file unless you can verify where it comes from. 
* Contact the sender through another channel to ask if it's real. 
* Upload it to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/), a service owned  by Google which will check for known malware. (It will not catch every attack.) 
* If you're still suspicious, read If you've been phished.

## If you receive any unexpected attachment, even if you're not otherwise susipcious: 

* Upload the file to an online document reader like Google Drive instead of downloading it to your computer. 
* Ask the sender to resend the content in the body of the email or a Google doc. 

## For any attachment at all: 

* Don't double click on it, even if you confirm it's safe. 
* Open attachments through the relevant program on your computer. For example, start Microsoft Word, and click Open under the File menu to open a .docx file. You're less likely to contract malware so it's a good habit to get into.
