title: Anonymity online on your mobile
---
Using your mobile to go online is often risker than using a computer, and it is nearly impossible to stay completley anonymous.  

However, Android users can enhance privacy when browsing the web using two apps from the [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/). 

# Orbot and Orfox

*	Orbot is a free, open-source Android app that enables other apps to use the internet more securely. 

*	Orfox is a web browser that uses Orbot to access the Internet using the Tor network. 

Together, Orbot and Orfox circumvent web censorship, and offer a more private internet connection. 

Learn how to use [Orbot and Orfox](umbrella://tools/tor/s_orbot-and-orfox.md). 

**Remember, these tools can only protect your anonymity if you do not log in to sites or post something online that could identify you!**
