# Withhold information

Information mined from your social media accounts can be used to impersonate or attack you and your contacts.

## Your name.

*   Consider whether to use your real name or not. Could your activity result in legal, physical, or social consequences? Are you willing to accept the risk? 

*   Consider creating separate social media accounts and pseudonyms for different activities. 

* Create a group identity to make it harder for others to hold an individual responsible for sensitive activity. (It's wise to assume that committed adversaries will still be able to identify members of the group.)     

*Note: Check the site's policy. For example, Facebook [requires](https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576?helpref=faq_content) users to go by "the name they go by in everyday life." Many interpret this broadly or ignore it, but an adversary could potentially [report](https://www.facebook.com/help/1216349518398524?helpref=hc_global_nav) a pseudonymous account for "pretending to be something or someone that doesn't exist."*

## Nonessential information.

*   Don't provide details like your birthday, phone number, and employment details just because the site asks for it. 

## Your email address.

*   If you are concerned with hiding your identity, create a separate email address for social media use. 

The social media site may still log your IP address, which can reveal your location. Use a VPN or the Tor Browser to disguise your location.

# Secure your account

Social media accounts can be hijacked, and fake accounts may be used to spread malware. 

## Use a strong password. 

*   Add 2FA where available. Change your password regularly.

## Answer security questions randomly.

Many social media sites use security questions to confirm your identity if you forget your password. 

*	Invent answers and store the answers in a password manager.

## Engage wisely

Attackers may befriend you to spy on your network or spread malware using social engineering. 

*   Only connect to people you know personally and trust. 

*	Be cautious of links and attachments, especially in direct messages. 

* Watch for unusual activity that may indicate a friend's account has been hacked or spoofed in order to trick you.
