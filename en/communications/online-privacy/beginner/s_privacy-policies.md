Social media sites can use, store, and share data about you, subject to their own policies.  

## Not just what you post

Social networking sites collect much more than your posts. 

They may track your location, your interests, your web browsing habits, and other personal information that could put you at risk. 

*On April 4, 2018, Facebook [said](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/) Facebook information of up to 87 million people may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a UK company that promises businesses and politicians that it can use data to change audience behaviour.* 

*The information was collected by a third party app called This is Your Digital Life, and [included](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/revealed-aleksandr-kogan-collected-facebook-users-direct-messages) at least some direct, private messages exchanged between Facebook users who had installed the app and unthinkingly given it permission to access their mailbox.*

## Read the small print 

Reading terms and conditions may feal like an impossible task, but look at how your data is used and shared with other parties, including government and law enforcement officials.
