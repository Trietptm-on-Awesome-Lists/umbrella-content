# Review settings frequently

Privacy settings are subject to change. Make sure your privacy hasn't been undermined or learn new ways to strengthen it.

# Block trackers

Browser extensions and add-ons can block trackers, like cookies, that transmit data about your online activity to third parties. Third parties may include ad networks, analytics providers, or other data collectors. 

[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) by EFF are examples of traffic blocking browser extensions.  

[Prevent online tracking](https://myshadow.org/prevent-online-tracking) from Me and My Shadow lists useful extensions.
