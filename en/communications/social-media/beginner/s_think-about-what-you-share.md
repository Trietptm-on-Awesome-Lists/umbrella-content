# Investigate yourself

Are you comfortable with the amount of information about you that is already public? 

Find out by [investigating yourself.](https://myshadow.org/self-doxing-exploring-you-visible-data-traces)

# Before you publish more information, always ask:  

### Who can access this?

### Who will control or profit from this?

### Who might share this?

### Who might mind if I share this?

### How much do I trust the companies and users I'm sharing with?

### Remember: 

*	It is easy for people to copy or share information, even people you trust, even unintentionally.

*	You can't see everything you're sharing. Every post reveals metadata about you and people you interact with.
