# Avoid malware 

## Update your Operating System: 

*	Android: Settings > About phone > System updates.
*	iPhone: Settings > General > Software updates.

## Update your apps: 

*	Android: Play store > Menu > "My apps and games."
*	iPhone: App store > Updates.

## Avoid suspicious apps. 

Apps may contain malware.

Do not install programmes that are unknown or from an unexpected source, including: 

*	Ring tones;
*	Wallpaper;
*	Apps;
*	Any unexpected download. 

## Uninstall apps you don't use.

## Connect securely.

*	Connect your phone to a computer only if you are sure it is malware free.

*	Avoid WiFi that doesn't require a password.

*	Switch off Infrared (IrDA), Bluetooth and WiFi when not in use. 

*	Transfer data using a cable instead of Bluetooth, which is easier to intercept. 

## Choose secure settings

Many settings and apps will make your phone more secure.
