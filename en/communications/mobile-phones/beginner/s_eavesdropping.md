# Spyware

Malicious software may allow an attacker to activate your microphone or camera remotely and spy on the surroundings, even when the phone appears to be off. 

Consider these options to protect yourself during sensitive meetings.  

## Turn off your phone

Turn off all phones and remove the batteries to make sure they can't be used to listen in on you. (Batteries can't always be removed in modern smartphone devices.)

*Note: many devices switched off at the same time may signal that a sensitive meeting is underway. To avoid this, take the battery out of your phone before you travel to the meeting or isolate your phone.*

## Isolate your phone

Leave phones in another room where the microphones can't overhear the conversations. 

# Theft and eavesdropping

Using a phone in public or in places that you don't trust makes you vulnerable to traditional eavesdropping techniques or to having your phone stolen.
