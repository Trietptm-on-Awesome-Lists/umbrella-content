# Transport encryption is not end-to-end

Most popular VoIP providers, such as Skype and Google Hangouts, offer transport encryption. 

Eavesdroppers cannot listen in, but the provider may. Whether this is a problem for you will depend on your threat model.

# Don't use Skype 

Avoid Skype if you discuss sensitive information: 

*	Skype is owned by Microsoft, which has a commercial interest in knowing when you use Skype and from where. 
*	Skype also may allow law enforcement agencies access to your communications.

## If you really need to use a less secure option: 

*   Download from the official website using https, such as [https://www.skype.com/en/](https://www.skype.com/en/).
*   Change your password regularly.
*   Do not store chat history (check the privacy settings).
*   Disable settings which automatically accept incoming files, which may introduce malware.
*   Always independently verify the identity of the other party (easier using video).
*   Decide if your username should identify you or your organisation.
*   Use code words for sensitive topics.
