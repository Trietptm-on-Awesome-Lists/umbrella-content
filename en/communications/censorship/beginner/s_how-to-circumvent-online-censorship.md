There are many tools to circumvent blocking and filtering. Some are more secure than others.

The tool that is most appropriate for you depends on your threat model.

# When circumvention doesn't work

Circumvention will not work if the information you are looking for has been removed, or if the Internet connection has been shut down. 

Appeal to the company involved, or conduct public advocacy, to challenge deletion or shutdowns.   

## Deletion

Internet companies may remove information if it violates their terms, or if authorities or other users complain.

## Shutdowns

Telecommunications companies may shut down mobile phone service, SMS messages, or mobile internet completely in one area, often following orders from local authorities.
