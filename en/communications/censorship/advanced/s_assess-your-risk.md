### Monitor the situation so that you are not surprised by a shutdown. 

## Past shutdowns

* In an unfamiliar area, find out if there have been shutdowns before. 

* In your local area, understand which companies control access to the Internet, and where the infrastructure connects you to other countries. 

*Several international connections controlled by several different entities makes the Internet you use more resilient.*

## Local reports

Read local news reports and ask around about the possibility of a shutdown. 

## Possible triggers 

*	Officials often threaten to shut down the Internet and social media. They can't always follow through, but threats and active shutdown tests are among the warning signs. 

*	Disruptive events like an election, a religious holiday, or an attack, are most likely to trigger a shutdown. 

*Countries that have not made explicit commitments to protect Internet access, and countries that already censor information, may copy the example of other authorities by implementing shutdowns, even if they haven't before.*
