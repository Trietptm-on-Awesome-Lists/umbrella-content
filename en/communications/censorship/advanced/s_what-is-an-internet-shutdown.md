title: What is an internet shutdown?
---
### Government agencies in dozens of countries have shut down Internet or mobile phone services, supposedly to keep people safe. Other security situations, like natural disasters, cause accidental shutdowns. 

## Deliberate Shutdowns

Those who implement deliberate shutdowns say their aim is to stop violence at public events or prevent rumours or illegal information from spreading. 

* Officials may order a company to turn off mobile data, home Internet, phone service, or SMS messaging; 
* Companies may slow down the network until its basically useless, also known as throttling;  
* Companies can also block entire social media services. This significantly curtails the experience of using the Internet in some parts of the world, and many people consider these blocks a kind of shutdown. 

## Accidental shutdowns

Various issues can cause unexpected network failure in some parts of the world:  

* Power fluctuations and outages;  
* Damage to the infrastructure after a natual disaster; 
* Overwhelming volume of activity during a public event. 

If you rely on secure apps to communicate, or if you are operating in a crowd that has no way to verify rumours, the security implications of Internet shutdowns are serious.
