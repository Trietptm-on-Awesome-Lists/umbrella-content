[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) is free, open-source software designed to give you anonymity on the web. 

It is a volunteer-run service that provides both privacy and anonymity online by masking who you are and where you are connecting. The service also protects you from the Tor network itself—you can have good assurance that you’ll remain anonymous to other Tor users.

Tor Browser is a web browser built on top of the Tor anonymity network. 

# Anonymity

When you use Tor, your Internet traffic is bounced around a distributed network of servers. The network you're communicating will only see the IP address of the last Tor router the traffic travelled through.

If properly configured, it can protect your identity from an adversary listening in on your country’s networks. 

# Circumvention

Because of how Tor routes your web traffic, it also provides a reliable, secure and public means of circumvention that saves you from having to assess proxies and VPNs for privacy and security. 

However, it can be slow and difficult to use.
