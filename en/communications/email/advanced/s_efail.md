In May 2018, security researchers released [information](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/not-so-pretty-what-you-need-know-about-e-fail-and-pgp-flaw-0) about Efail, vulnerabilities in PGP email clients that could expose past or future content, even if it was encrypted. 

The clients were patched to fix the issue. But the incident was a helpful reminder that encrypting email is a complicated process. 

* Secure messaging services like Signal are easier, more common, and therefore more reliable, than encrypting email. If you're sending sensitive information, do it in a secure message instead of an email.

* Always make sure the software you are running is up to date.
