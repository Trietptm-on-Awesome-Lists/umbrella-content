# Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

End-to-end encryption protects your data from everyone except you and the recipient.  

PGP is the standard for end-to-end encryption. 

If used correctly, it can protect content from being read by:

*	Your email provider;
*	Government or law enforcement officials.

Whether you need end-to-end encryption for your email depends on your threat model.

(Learn to assess your threat model in the [managing information](umbrella://information/managing-information) lesson.)
