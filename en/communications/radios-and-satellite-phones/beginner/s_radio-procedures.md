# Follow simple, standard procedures

*   Maintain equipment in optimum condition.

*   Train staff and visitors to use radios.

*   Post authorized frequencies and selective calling lists in base stations and mobile units.

*   Monitor radios 24 hours a day in moderate, high, or severe risk alert countries.

*   Avoid excessive calling. Use radios for work-related purposes only.

*	Establish duress code words. Select innocuous words or phrases to indicate that the speaker is in a threatening situation but not free to communicate.

## When using the radio: 

*   Wait for others to finish and sign off before beginning transmission.

*   Be brief but precise with clear pauses between statements.

*   Use common procedure words (prowords). View a list [here](http://arkisto.teres.fi/toiminta/koulutus/procedure_for_radio_communication.pdf).

*   Use call signs instead of personal names. 

*   Speak clearly with normal rhythm and moderate volume.

*   Hold the microphone 5cm from your mouth.

## Never: 

*	Identify organizations or personnel by name over the radio.

*	Transmit security or travel information.

*	Discuss transfer of cash or goods.
