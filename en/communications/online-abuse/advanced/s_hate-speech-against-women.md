title: Hate speech against women
---
Women with visibility on the internet receive a disproportionate amount of hateful speech because the internet remains a male-dominated space. 

Women's visibility in online spaces challenges gender inequality and male privilege.

## The goal of abuse

Abusers seek to intimidate and silence female commentators to preserve the status quo.

*	Hate speech is directed at journalists, bloggers and activists simply because they are women. 

*	Women are attacked regardless of what they are writing about, but especially if they write about anything to do with women or tackle male-dominated subjects.

*	Women are attacked because of their sexuality and physical appearance, not their ideas. 

*	When the writer is a woman of colour and/or LGBTQI, she will often face hate speech attacking her gender, race/ethnicity and sexuality.

*	Online attacks discourage women from writing, earning a living, and participating in public life on the internet. 

## Speak up

Everyone needs to work to end the discrimination faced by women online.

*	Document and acknowledge the problem.
