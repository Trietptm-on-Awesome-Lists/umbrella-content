## Criminal law

While some authorities are only just beginning to understand online abuse, legislation is emerging. 

For example, many jurisdictions now specifically prohibit the unauthorised posting of intimate images online.

## Copyright

Copyright establishes two rights â€“ economic and moral. The moral rights of copyright allow you to claim authorship of a photo or video and the right to prohibit its distribution.

Photographs and videos are considered artistic productions. Some women have used copyright laws to register intimate images they took of themselves and were later misused without their consent in order to build a legal case for reclaiming ownership and demanding withdrawal from the public domain.

The Berne Convention guarantees that copyright protection is obtained automatically; there is no need for registration or other formalities. Some national copyright offices and laws allow you to register works, which may facilitate legal cases.

## Right to be forgotten

In Europe, the Right to be Forgotten can be used to demand that search engines remove links with personal information because it is irrelevant. The burden of proof is on the search engine to prove that the data cannot be deleted because it is still relevant. The law applies to all companies, including those outside the EU, which serve European citizens.
