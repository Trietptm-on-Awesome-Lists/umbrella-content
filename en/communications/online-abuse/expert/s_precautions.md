# Protect your data

## Secure intimate photos 

Phones are easily lost and stolen, which makes their data vulnerable.

Transfer sensitive photos to a more secure location, such as a USB stick, as soon as you can. While they are on your phone, encrypt them and keep them in a password-protected file.

## Turn off automatic cloud saving  

iPhone: 

* Turn off iCloud sharing in Settings > iCloud > Photos > option Off. 
* Disable iCloud completely in Menu > “delete account.” 
    
Android: 

* Double check your settings are not backing up to the Google+ cloud service in the Photos app > General Settings > Auto-Backup to Off. 
* Check your cloud frequently to know exactly what is stored there.

*	Return the phone to its factory settings. 
*	For Android, go to settings > privacy > select Factory Data Reset. Instructions vary with different models, so consult the manual or the internet.
