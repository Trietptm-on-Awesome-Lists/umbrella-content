# Disguise VeraCrypt

## If you are concerned about encryption software being found on your device:

*   Name your encrypted volume to look like a different type of file. 

> *For example: adding an '.iso' file extension makes volumes around 700 MB look like a CD image. Other extensions would be more realistic for smaller volumes.*

*   Use a portable version of VeraCrypt, instead of installing it on your computer. (Even in portable mode, VeraCrypt may leave traces indicating it has been used on your device.)
