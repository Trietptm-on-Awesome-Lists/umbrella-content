title: Full Disk Encryption
---
### Most smartphones and computers offer complete, full-disk encryption.

## Smartphones and tablets

* Android offers full-disk encryption when you first set up newer devices. You can also enable it manually under security settings.

(Learn [Basic Security Setup for Android](umbrella://tools/other/s_android.md).)

* Apple devices such as the iPhone and iPad describe encryption as “Data Protection” and turn it on if you set a passcode.

(Learn to [Encrypt your iPhone](umbrella://tools/encryption/s_encrypt-your-iphone.md).)

## Computers:

* Apple provides a built-in, full-disk encryption feature on macOS called FileVault.  
* Linux distributions usually offer full-disk encryption when you first set up your system.
* Windows Vista or later includes a full-disk encryption feature called BitLocker.

*BitLocker's code is closed and proprietary, which means it is hard to know how secure it is. Using BitLocker requires you trust Microsoft provides a secure storage system without hidden vulnerabilities. Consider an alternative open-source operating system such as GNU/Linux or BSD, especially a version that has been hardened against security attacks, such Tails or Qubes. Alternatively, consider installing an alternative disk encryption software, Veracrypt, to encrypt your hard drive.*

Remember: Whatever your device calls it, encryption is only as good as your password. 

Use dice and a word list to create a passphrase of at least 6 randomly choose words. 

(Learn about [Passwords](umbrella://information/passwords).)

It is not always possible to use a long passphrase on a mobile device. 

Keep truly sensitive information hidden, or store it on a much more secure device.
