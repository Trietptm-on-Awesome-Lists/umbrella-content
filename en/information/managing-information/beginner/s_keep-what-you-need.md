title: Keep what you need
---
### There are two basic rules for managing sensitive information. 

## 1. Keep only what you need.

If there is no good reason to keep sensitive information, delete it. 

(Learn more about [safely deleting](umbrella://information/safely-deleting)).

## 2. Keep it need to know.

Compartmentalise sensitive information that could put people at risk. This means you only know it if you really need to. 

*For example, if your team is working with a high-risk source, keep her real name on a need to know basis. Her direct contact needs it. The rest of the team can use a code name instead.*

### This lesson outlines how to work out which information is sensitive, and who you need to protect it from. This process is called threat modelling or risk assessment.
