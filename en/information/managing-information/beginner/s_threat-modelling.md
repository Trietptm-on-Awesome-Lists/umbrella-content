### You must identify and understand specific threats before you can counter them. 

The process of identifying threats is called threat modelling. The process of identifying how likely is it that threats will occur is called a risk assessment. 

Whatever you call it, it's a good idea to make a security plan.

## How to make a security plan

1. Find out what threats you face;
2. Identify steps to defend yourself based on the answers.  

## Sample assessment questions

* 	What do you need to protect?
* 	Who do you need to protect it from? 
* 	Where are you? 
* 	What are you working on?
* 	Who are you working with?

This lesson assesses threats to information. 

No single solution will keep information safe for everyone. Understand your risk to protect *your* information.
