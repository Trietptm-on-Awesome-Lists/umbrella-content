title: Make a plan

### Create a detailed response plan for any space, including personal residences, that may be the target of a raid.  

## Know your rights

What legal guidance will you and your team need during the raid, and where will you keep it? 

Consider: 

* What laws could prompt a raid? 
* Is there a risk of arrest? 
* Do you have any right to refuse access, delay, or to withhold or destroy devices and documents? What is the possible penalty? 
* Are you legally required to enter passwords or decrypt devices and documents?
* What information, if any, are officials not legally allowed to access? For example, communications with a lawyer may be privileged. How will you separate, mark, or otherwise protect it? 

## Create a communications plan. 

* Who needs to be alerted when a raid begins, and how? (Email, message, call?)
* What contact information do you need, and where will you keep it? 
* How will you document what happens during the raid for your records or to prove abuse?
* Will it help to publicise the raid in the media, on social media, or to people in your field? How will you make that decision? 
* Where possible, draft language in advance to avoid errors and reduce decision-making under stress. 

## Protect information

* What sensitive information can you hide or remove to prevent officials from accessing it? 
* What information can you mark or separate because officials are not allowed to access it?
* What steps could you take to protect sensitive information or obstruct a search at short notice, like shut down a device, dismount a VeraCrypt folder, or soak paper in water? What is the possible penalty attached to each step? Is it worth it?
