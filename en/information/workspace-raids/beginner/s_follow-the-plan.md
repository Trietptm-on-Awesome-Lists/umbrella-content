# Follow your response plan

## First steps

* Immediately notify lawyers, senior team members, and other allies. 
* If possible, keep officials in a lobby or meeting room away from devices and documents while you learn what's happening. Ask officials to delay until lawyers arrive. 
* Take steps to shut down or hide sensitive information if appropriate, but understand the possible penalties. 
* Stop normal operations that could appear defiant, like shredding paper.  
* Be calm and cooperative if you can, without volunteering information. 

*Cooperation could help you withstand a legitimate investigation, or reduce the risk of aggression if the raid is hostile.* 

## Who are you dealing with? 

* Confirm which agency is carrying out the raid, and under what authority. 
* Identify who is in charge. Ask for ID. Take copies.    
* Ask for a warrant, or any other information about the raid. Take copies. 
* If anything is removed, ask for copies and receipts.  

*Indicate if the authorities are not allowed to seize something, for example, privileged communications with a lawyer.*   
 
## Monitor

* Stay with each official during the raid. Use multiple lawyers or team members if necessary. 
* Take detailed notes. Which devices and documents are accessed or searched? Which are removed? 
* If appropriate for your legal situation and risk level, record video or audio.  
* Understand next steps as best you can. Who can you call with questions? 

## Restore

* Warn people you work with if sensitive information has been accessed or seized. 
* Increase security measures to mitigate increased risk if necessary. 
* Replace devices as needed. 
* Restore information from backups as needed. 
* Work with your lawyer to protect yourself in case of ongoing investigations. 
* Adjust your risk assessment if the raid could signal a change in your operating environment. 
* Seek international or emergency support if necessary.
