title: What are workplace raids?
---
### Police or other officials may seize devices and documents from your workplace as part of a harassment campaign or legitimate investigation.  

Homes and residences are also subject to raids.  

Raids may be:

* Unnannounced or outside normal working hours to give you less time to prepare;
* One-off events, or connected to much longer term legal investigations; 
* Deliberately punitive, a pretext, or standard legal procedure, depending on your work and operating environment.  
 
This lesson offers suggestions to help you prepare for, and respond to raids that relate to your work. 

*The best advice will depend on the legal system you are operating in. Ask your peers to share their experience, and seek legal advice in advance.*
