title: Using anti-virus software effectively
---
Follow these tips when using anti-virus software. 

(Learn more about this in [Malware Beginner](umbrella://information/malware/beginner).)

## Uninstall one anti-virus program before installing another.

Do not run two anti-virus programs at the same time. This might cause your computer to run extremely slowly or to crash. (However, anti-malware software is designed to work alongside anti-virus software.)

## Run the latest version and make sure it will update automatically. 

Without updates, anti-virus software can quickly become ineffective.

## Enable the 'always on' virus-detection feature. 

If your software has one, it may also be called 'Realtime Protection,' 'Resident Protection,' or something similar.

## Scan your computer regularly. 

Some tools do this automatically, but additional scans may be necessary in some cases: 

* 	Have you connected your computer to unknown networks recently? 
* 	Do you share USB memory sticks or use them on different computers? 
* 	Do you frequently receive attachments by email? 
* 	Has someone else in your home or office recently had virus problems? 

Anti-malware software requires full access to your operating system in order to look for infected files and detect malicious behaviour. As a result, there are some situations where installing it could actually increase your level of risk, especially if it is poorly designed or compromised by a back door. But it is almost always in your favor to install an anti-malware tool, especially on Windows. 

## Advanced solutions

If you are highly technical or believe you may be facing a powerful adversary, there are other ways to protect yourself from malware. 

Consider: 

* Switching to a hardened operating system like [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) or [Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/); 
* Accessing sensitive content on an air gapped machine with no network access.
