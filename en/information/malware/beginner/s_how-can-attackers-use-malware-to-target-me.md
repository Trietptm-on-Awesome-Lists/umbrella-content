Attackers usually try to trick you into installing malware. They may:  

## Disguise it as something else:

*   A link to a website, a document, a software update, or even a program designed to help secure your computer;
*   Email from someone you know, a message on Skype or Twitter, or a link posted to your Facebook page.

## Infect removable media:

*   A USB key or CD given to you or found near your office;
* 	External hardrives;
* 	A device connected to a computer to charge.

## Install it directly:

An attacker with physical access to your computer may install malware directly.
