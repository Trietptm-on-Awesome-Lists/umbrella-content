# Insecure delete

The Secure Empty Trash feature was removed in OS X 10.11, because Apple could not guarantee secure deletion on the fast flash (SSD) drives used in most of its modern models. 

(On OS X 10.4 to 10.10, you can move sensitive files to the Trash, then select Finder > Secure Empty Trash.)

# Protect sensitive files

Protect sensitive files using encryption instead: 

* Make sure the built-in FileVault utility is enabled (this requires you to enter a password to use your Mac).  
* Use VeraCrypt, a free, open-source tool for file encryption.
