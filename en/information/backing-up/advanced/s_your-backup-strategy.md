# Secure copies

Your challenge is to make sure that each data type is stored securely in at least two separate locations.

You will need a combination of software and processes. 

## Electronic documents.

* Create a full backup of the documents on your computer using a program like Cobian Backup. 
* Store the backup on a portable external hard drive, CD/DVD or USB memory stick that you can keep  in a safe location. 
* Encrypt electronic document backups to protect sensitive information. 

(Learn more about [protecting files](umbrella://information/protecting-files) using [VeraCrypt](umbrella://tools/files/s_veracrypt.md).)

## Program databases.

* Programs and apps store calendar entries, contacts, media files, and other important information in folders or databases. Identify their locations and include them in regular backups.  
* Back them up in the same way as electronic documents.

## Email. 

* Install an email client like Thunderbird rather than using a web browser. 
* Most webmail services will provide instructions on how to import your contact list using an email client. 
* You may also choose to move old email messages to your computer so they are not stored on a remote server for security reasons. 
* Back them up in the same way as electronic documents.

(Learn more about Thunderbird in the PGP guides for [Linux](umbrella://tools/pgp/s_pgp-for-linux.md), [Mac OS](umbrella://tools/pgp/s_pgp-for-mac-os-x.md), and [Windows](umbrella://tools/pgp/s_pgp-for-windows.md).) 

## Mobile phone. 

* To back up phone numbers and SMS text messages, connect your mobile phone to your computer using the appropriate software, which is generally available from the website of the company that manufactured your phone. 
* You may need to find or buy a particular cable.

## Printed documents.

* Where possible, scan your important papers. 
* Back them up in the same way as electronic documents.
