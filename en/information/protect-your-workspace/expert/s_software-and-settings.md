### Some settings make your devices less vulnerable to physical threats.

- Password protect your devices and encrypt the storage. 

(Learn about [protecting files](umbrella://information/protecting-files), [basic security for Android](umbrella://tools/other/s_android.md) and [encrypt your iPhone](umbrella://tools/encryption/s_encrypt-your-iphone.md).)

- If you run any servers in your office, work with whoever maintains them to ensure that the information they contain will be encrypted if they are turned off or unplugged.

- Enable the lock screen on your smartphone, and get in the habit of locking your screen whenever you step away from your computer. Windows, Mac and Linux computers all have keyboard shortcuts that allow you to do this quickly and easily. 

- Configure your computer's Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), a deep layer of software that lets you set advanced prerences, so that your computer will not boot from the USB, CD-ROM or DVD drives. Password protect the BIOS so an intruder can't change this setting. 

- If you store the login and BIOS passwords for your computer in a password manager, keep a copy of the database on a different device to avoid getting locked out. 

(Learn more about this in [passwords](umbrella://information/passwords/advanced).)

- Consider activating "Find my Device" features so that you can locate or wipe the contents on a lost, stolen or confiscated device.
