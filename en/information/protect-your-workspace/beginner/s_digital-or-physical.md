title: Digital or physical?
---
### Evaluate the threats your information is vulnerable to. 

Information is vulnerable in different ways. 

## Is the threat digital or physical? 

* When you use anti-malware tools to protect the contents of a USB memory stick, you are making a decision about digital security. 
* When you put the USB memory stick in your pocket instead of your luggage, you are making a decision about physical security, even though the information you are trying to protect is digital. 

Some information security practices are helpful against digital *and* physical threats, like having a good off-site backup policy.

## Physical security

Your physical security plan should identify threats to sensitive information due to physical theft, loss or destruction. 

The best plan depends on the situation. 

* Are you walking across town or travelling across a border? 
* Will somebody else be carrying your bag? 
* Is it raining? 
* What other questions should you consider when making physical security decisions?
