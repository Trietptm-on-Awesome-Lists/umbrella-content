### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develops when people don't heal from traumatic stress.

PTSD develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. 

You may be more susceptible to PTSD after a trauma if:  

*	You or a relative has had depression or anxiety;
*	You don't receive much support from family or friends.

PTSD usually develops in the month after the trauma. 

_A minority of people develop symptoms months or even years later._
