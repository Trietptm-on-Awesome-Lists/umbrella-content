### Chronic stress is caused by repeated exposure to stress.

Healthy stress symptoms are mild and temporary. People return to normal when the stress factor is removed. 

If exposure to stress is excessive or long-term, symptoms persist and multiply, resulting in chronic or cumulative stress. 

## Chronic stress can: 

*	Cause physical and mental symptoms;

*	Erode coping mechanisms;

*	Build up slowly over time;

*	Be hard to notice in yourself or others; 

*	Lead to burnout if not properly managed.
