### Provide a safe and supportive environment.

## Psychological first aid 

Psychological first aid involves supporting people after a trauma. 

*	Make sure they are safe. 

*   Ask if they require assistance. 

*   Ask what they need most right now.  

*   Listen and help them feel calm.

*	Do not leave someone who is very distressed by themselves.

*	Allow them to share their experience if they choose to, with no pressure or obligation.

_Do not require people to debrief or recount what happened._
