A tracker is a device placed on a vehicle to monitor its location.

Sophisticated trackers monitor the target in real time, and store historical data. Others only reveal the target's route after they are retrieved.

### You may be at risk if:

*	Your movements are of interest to an adversary with resources;
*	You routinely use the same vehicle and park it somewhere accessible. 

## Check for trackers

1. Regularly;
2. Before sensitive trips.

### Trackers may be: 

*	Stuck to the underside of a car with magnets; 
*	In the boot or trunk;
*	On the roof;
*	The size of a phone or smaller;
*	Disguised with tape or oil.

_Get right under the car and feel around corners._

Devices in the vehicle, like a mobile or satellite phone, can also be tracked.
