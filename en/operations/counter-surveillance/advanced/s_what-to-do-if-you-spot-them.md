# Be discreet 

If you suspect surveillance, do not react or raise the surveillance team's suspicions. 

**Remember your first goal is to find out whether you are being followed, not to lose them.**

# Take action 

If you confirm you are under surveillance, you have three options:

### 1. Change your plans (safe, recommended) 

For example, ask your team to meet you at a neutral location where you can safely lead a watcher. 

This allows you to: 

*	Keep your original plan secure;
*	Convey that your activity is not worth surveillance.

### 2. Lose the surveillance covertly 

If you must stick to your plan, and if you feel it is safe: 

*	Lose the surveillance team *without* them knowing that thay have been made;
*	Make it look accidental. 

### 3. Lose the surveillance overtly (risky) 

If it is absolutely vital to lose the surveillance, and it is not possible to do so covertly:

*	Lose the surveillance team *even if* it makes them aware that they have been made.  

Overt counter-surveillance is also known as anti-surveillance. 

Be aware that this strategy may: 

*	Confirm that you don't want to be watched;
*	Increase the likelihood of further surveillance.

*Consider leading a watcher to a police station if you anticipate a serious incident and are not at risk from the police. This will depend on your threat model.*
