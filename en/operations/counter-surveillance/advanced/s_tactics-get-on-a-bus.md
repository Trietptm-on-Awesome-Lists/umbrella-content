### Switching from walking to riding makes it harder for watchers to keep up.

# Get on a bus

Buses are slower than other vehicles, making them harder to follow by car. 
 
*	Make sure you can pay the fare. 
*	Sit at the back to observe who follows.
*	Sit where you can observe other vehicles overtaking.
*	For covert counter-surveillance, switch to a second bus going a different way to make it look like you are lost.
*	For overt anti-surveillance, get off at the next stop, and rapidly get on another bus. 

# Get on a train

Trains are faster than other vehicles, making them hard to follow.  

*	Try to be the last passenger on the train. 
*	Stand at the end of the platform to observe other passengers. 
*	Get off before your destination.
*	For covert counter-surveillance, switch to a second train going a different way to make it look like you are lost.
*	For overt anti-surveillance, rapidly change trains at the last minute. 

# Get a taxi

Taxi drivers may have useful local knowledge. In some countries they can use bus lanes, making them harder for surveillance vehicles to follow.
