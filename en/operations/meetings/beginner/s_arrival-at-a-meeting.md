## Practise counter-surveillance

*	Remove phone batteries before you arrive to avoid being tracked. (This doesn't work in all modern smartphone devices.)

*Note: many devices switched off at the same time may signal that a sensitive meeting is underway. To avoid this, take the battery out of your phone before you travel to the meeting or isolate your phone.*

(Learn about [mobile phones](umbrella://communications/mobile-phones))

*	Practise counter-surveillance en route. Ensure you are clear before you arrive. 

(Learn about [counter-surveillance](umbrella://operations/counter/surveillance/beginner).) 

## Check the meeting place

*	Arrive first to check for possible surveillance;
*	Survey approaches, entrance, exits, and toilets;
*	Do not buy anything or unpack until you are sure you are clear;
*	Be prepared to switch to your alternate location at the last minute if there is a problem. 

## Monitor the meeting place

*	Sit where you can see the rest of the space;
*	Sit with your back to a wall; 
*	Sit near the exit or identify an escape route.

## Observe other people

*	Observe people who enter after the person you are meeting;
*	Observe anyone who sits close to you;
*	Look for indicators of a surveillance team.

(Learn more about this in [counter-surveillance advanced](umbrella://operations/counter/surveillance/advanced).)

## Collaborate 

Team members who do not need to participate can arrive separately. 

*	Don't indicate that you know each other. 
*	Position them nearby to check for surveillance. 
*	Ask them to signal if there is a problem or they can overhear your conversation. 
*	If a participant at risk is not counter-surveillance trained, ask a team member to check for surveillance.
