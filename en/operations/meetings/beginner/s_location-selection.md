# Choose a meeting place

*	If participants may be surveillance targets, avoid homes, hotels, offices, and other frequented locations. 

*	Choose a neutral public place, such as a caf√©. 

*	Choose somewhere easy to fit in.

*	Avoid places known to attract certain groups or people at risk.

*	Look for images and information online if you can't go in advance.

*	Open spaces make eavesdropping harder, but may also make it harder to fit in.

Consider:

*   Who goes there?
*   What do they wear?
*   What size groups do they sit in?
*   Are tables close together so you might be overheard?
*   Is it likely to be crowded?
*   Will going there attract notice or suspicion?

## Have a backup

*	Choose an alternate meeting place nearby.

*	Agree a discreet signal to alert others if something is wrong.
