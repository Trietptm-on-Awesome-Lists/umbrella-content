### If arrest or detention is likely:  

## Plan ahead

*   Know your legal rights;

* Find a lawyer or decide who else you will call on for help;

*	Check in regularly with someone who can provide support if you fail to check in;

*	Create a protocol for conduct during questioning. In other words, decide how you will behave and what you are prepared to reveal.

## Protect your information

*	Decide what information is sensitive. Only carry what you really need.

(Learn more about this in [managing information](umbrella://lesson/managing-information).)

*	If your devices may be seized, harden them against searches.  

(Learn more about this in [protests](umbrella://lesson/protests/1).)

*	If you may be forced to reveal your passwords, prepare an account with unimportant information to reveal in order to protect a sensitive one with the same service.
