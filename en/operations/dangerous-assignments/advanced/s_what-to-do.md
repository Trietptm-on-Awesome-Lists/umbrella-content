When getting notice of a crime, corroborate the veracity of the alert with the proper authorities (time, place, people involved). Criminals sometimes set traps for journalists by alerting them of crimes that did not happen.

## WHAT TO DO

* Confirm that the scene has been secured by some authority (police, military). Do not arrive before it is appropriately guarded.
* Verify with colleagues if they have the same information.
* Try to go to the scene accompanied by other colleagues.
* Carry your journalist ID in a visible manner.
* Practice counter-surveillance to identify people staking out the place. In many cases, criminal groups send “watchers” to identify journalists covering the scene.
* Practice counter-surveillance when you leave the scene and head back to your workplace or home.
* Let a trusted contact know where the crime scene is located and send a text message when you arrive, when you leave and at several times in between.
* When pursuing reports of a shootout, do not approach until you’re certain the skirmish is over.
* Respect signs and instructions from the authorities charged with guarding and investigating the scene.
