title: Attending a crime scene
---
This lesson describes how to stay safe when attending a crime scene for work, especially as a journalist.  

Attending a crime scene can be dangerous in many places due to the violent criminal groups that are involved, such as drug cartels or gangs related to organized crime. Itâ€™s also risky because journalistic work sometimes comes into conflict with the work of investigative authorities. 

Covering the scene of crimes such as homicide, kidnapping or a shootout calls for security measures to safeguard the safety of journalists and other observers as well as the integrity of the investigation. A reporter has to balance the need to have timely information with personal safety.
