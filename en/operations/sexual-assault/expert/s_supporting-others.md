title: Supporting others

## Witnesses 

*	Anyone who witnessed the assault and was unable to prevent it will also need
support. 

## Other team members 

*	If others know what happened, expect shock, disorientation, depression,
anger and confusion in the team. 
*	Other team members may have been victims of rape in the past. Depending on their
own healing process they may or may not be well placed to provide support; they may require support themselves. 

## Supporters

*	Supporting rape victims is stressful and demanding. 
* 	Those doing so should also monitor their own emotions, which may become turbulent. 
*  Supporters should be able to share their feelings in a confidential setting with someone who can help them constructively evaluate their response.

## Family

*	Seek the advice and consent of the victim about informing family what has happened. 
* 	If the victim is relocated after the incident, consult them about what reason to give others.  
*	Designate a team member to liaise closely with the family if there is media coverage of the incident.
