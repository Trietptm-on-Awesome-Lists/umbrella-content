## Direct attacks

People like you may be considered potential targets if individuals or groups: 

* Perceive you as an ally of their enemy;
* Perceive you as a threat to their agenda;
* Perceive you as a soft target; 
* Perceive you as high profile, guaranteeing a reaction from others;
* Oppose your activities. 

## Indirect attacks

You may be affected by attacks on an unrelated target if individuals or groups:  

* Seek to cause mass casualties by targeting crowds or transport systems;
* Seek to damage or disable infrastructure; 
* Seek to disrupt social and economic activities.

## What could a terrorist attack look like?

* Physical attacks involving weapons (such as bombs, guns, knives, vehicles)
* Disabling digital attacks on devices or networks (such as hacking, DDOS or distributed denial of service attacks) 

## What should you call it? 

In security planning, use the word terrorism with care. 
 
* Terrorism is a catch-all term that applies to many different kinds of threat. It may help to be more specific. 
* Many standard security measures or crisis management plans also apply to acts of terror. Will a terrorism-specific policy reassure your team, or instill fear? 
* Anti-terror measures may be used by others as a pretext to monitor you or restrict your access to public spaces or information. People you work with may be suspicious of security agendas that evoke terrorist threats. 
* The difference between crime and terrorism matters for law and politics, less for security. 

*Security measures should help you prepare and respond to threats you face, regardless of the motive or identity of the individual or group responsible.*
