### You may discover, receive, or need to search for, suspicious objects or packages. 

Any foreign, unidentified object that could conceal a threat to people nearby should be considered suspicious. The concealed threat could include:

* A bomb or explosive device; 
* Biological, chemical or radioactive hazards;
* Anything else that could harm people nearby.  

# Searching for objects

* Is the search routine or urgent? 

*Setting up routine searches of shared spaces could help you identify suspicious objects faster in a crisis.* 

* Should the search be covert, or in the open? 
* Will people need to leave the space before it is searched? 
* Who should carry out the search? 

*Team members can search their own space quickly and efficiently, but evaluate the risk  and seek expert help if you are responding to a specific threat.*  

## Where to look

* Under desks and chairs;
* In drawers, bins or trash receptacles; 
* Around anything recently moved or missing;
* In bathrooms, utility rooms, or storage spaces;
* Around machinery, water and electricity supplies;
* Around light fixtures;
* In tunnels or under trapdoors;
* Rooftops or underground garages;
* Outside in drainage areas, post boxes, shrubs and bushes, parked vehicles.

# Screening for packages

* Who receives packages, mail, or post? 
* Have they been trained to identify suspicious objects and packages? 
* Can they examine everything they receive in an isolated room? 
* Has everyone else been alerted to the risks of receiving suspicious or unexpected packages? 

## What to look for

The package is suspicious because something about it isn't right. Trust your instinct. 

Is the package: 

* Unexpected;
* Showing recipient's name or title missing or incorrect;  
* Messy, misspelled, misaddressed;
* Unusually rigid, bulky, lopsided;
* Warm;
* Carrying an unusual smell;
* Showing visible powder, wire, stains?   

# If you see a suspicious object or package:

* Don't touch it or anything attached to it; 
* Contact your security expert, crisis team, or emergency responders immediately;
* Report exactly what you see and why the object is suspicious;
* Evacuate the area if needed; 
* Isolate it if needed; 
* Opening windows could help diffuse fumes or pressure waves.
