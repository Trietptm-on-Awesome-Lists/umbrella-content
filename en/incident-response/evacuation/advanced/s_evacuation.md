Evacuation takes precedence over all other activities. 

During this stage: 

*   Inform your team and relevant embassies.

*   If there is a risk of looting, consider disabling radios, equipment and vehicles. Empty safes and leave them open.

*   Ensure effective communication with anyone leaving and anyone staying. 

*   Assemble evacuees at the meeting point or safe house.

*   Evacuate by the safest route available.

*	Maintain good order.

## What it means for you

An evacuation is not easy for those leaving or those staying.  It is a very emotional event, giving rise to feelings of guilt, hurt, frustration, and powerlessness.  

## What it means for others

Your departure may have meaning for people staying. Evacuation may represent the removal of a symbolic or real safety barrier. 

Evacuation is not neutral, and may even aggravate a crisis.  

If appropriate, consider providing a statement for the media and others. Explain your reasoning and what it means for your work.
