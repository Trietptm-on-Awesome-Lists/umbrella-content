### The process of preserving evidence requires sensitivity and the victim's informed consent. 

Typical items of evidence include the victim’s clothes (unlaundered), pubic
hair, evidence of genital or other injury and semen. 

## Forensic evidence 

To be acceptable in court, medical evidence needs to be collected and handled under certain
prescribed conditions.   

Ask a lawyer:

*	Who has the legal authority to collect forensic evidence in the case of rape;
* 	What forensic evidence is admissible in the prosecution of a rape; 
*  What procedures of collection, examination and storage must be followed
to ensure that the evidence will be admissible.

### Key principles:

*	The victim should be fully informed what is being done and why. Evidence should only be collected with the victim’s written consent.
*	Collecting evidence does not commit the victim to legal action, but
preserves the possibility of legal action.

### Common problems

*	Victims often want to wash, change, and dispose of clothes and other reminders of what happened. This
does not destroy all evidence, but makes it more difficult to collect.
*	Collecting certain physical evidence will require a medically trained person
and appropriate equipment.
*	Evidence must be sealed, handled and stored in a correct and appropriate manner, for example in paper not plastic bags, sealed and marked; some needs to be refrigerated. 
*	There should be minimal transfers and people handling evidence. A log should be kept of who handled it and when to preserve the chain of custody. 
* 	Time limits on collection may be imposed, after which evidence is inadmissible in court.
